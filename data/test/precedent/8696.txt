In Mahmood v. State of U.P. (1976) 1 SCC 542 1975 Indlaw SC 643 it has been observed that in a case dependent wholly on circumstantial evidence the court must be satisfied - (a)that the circumstances from which the inference of guilt is to be drawn, have been fully established by unimpeachable evidence beyond a shadow of doubt; (b)that the circumstances are of a determinative tendency unerringly pointing towards the guilt of the accused; and (c)that the circumstances, taken collectively, are incapable of explanation on any reasonable hypothesis save that of the guilt sought to be proved against him	Precedent
