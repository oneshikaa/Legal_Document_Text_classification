To say that the words "finally disposed of" mean finally disposed of so far as the High Court is concerned is illogical because Rules 1,4 and 7 use the words "be heard and disposed of by a Divisional Bench" and were the reasoning of the Full Bench correct,it would mean that so far as the High Court is concerned,when a Single Judge hears a matter and disposes it of,it is finally disposed of and when a Division Bench disposes it of,it is not finally disposed of	Precedent
