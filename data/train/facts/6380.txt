The High Court negatived the contentions urged by the appellants and took the view that in the determination by the competent authority under s.2 (4) (i) of the Act that the respondent's Jagir was a proprietary one there was implicit decision that the respondent was a grantee of the soil which included sub-soil entitling him to mines and mineral products and as such a further inquiry by the Collector under S.37(2) of the Bombay Land Revenue Code was incompetent and without jurisdiction and,therefore,the Collector's order dated February 23,1973 was liable to be quashed	Ruling by Lower Court
