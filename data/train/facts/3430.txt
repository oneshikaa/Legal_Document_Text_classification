A.R.Khan,Secretary (Revenue) has made many appointments of Mandols/ Process Servers/ Zilladars in the recent months against which I have been complaining that the Secretary (Revenue) has no power or authority to make any appointments of field staff as per Rules provided under M.L.R.Act,1960.In this regard,I have apprised the matter to the Hon'ble Minister (Revenue) already and also informed the Chief Secretary,Manipur explaining that the Secretary (Revenue) cannot make such appointments of field staffs,even if he wanted to do so,all the relevant files should have been routed through the undersigned so that the same may be brought to the notice of the Hon'ble Minister (Revenue).His action has created lots of misunderstanding and confusion	Facts
