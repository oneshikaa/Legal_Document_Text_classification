In the special circumstances of this case,particularly when after 2.4.07 appeals against orders rejecting "pre-grant opposition" are not maintainable and particularly when FAO No.292/06 and FAO No.293/06 were filed by respondent no.3 prior to 2.4.07 under the old law,we are of the view that these two appeals shall be heard and decided by the High Court in accordance with law	Ratio of the decision
