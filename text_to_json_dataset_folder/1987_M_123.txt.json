        "Suspecting that the entry in the Protected Tenancy Register might not be genuine,on or about 24th of October,1970 the Tahsildar passed an order cancelling that entry\t",
        "The main question centres around the right of Abdul Khader,respondent No.1 herein to the compensation awarded by the arbitrator,it is therefore,necessary to refer to the relevant portion of the said order which inter alia,stated as follows: \"By perusal of the Tenancy Register of 1958 it is evident that Sri Mohd\t",

        "In the appeal of Abdul Khader the proceedings of Revenue Divisional Officer while questioning entry of the name of Abdul Khader in the Register is a genuine one or net and while it is stated that it was entered in the Register in such suspicious way by giving Serial No.1/A between Serial Nos.1 and 2 of Register being Exhibit A.106 and Exhibit A.107,it ultimately held that Abdul Khader was a protected tenant under section 37A of the Andhra Pradesh Act\t",
        "On or about 19th of April,1972\t",
        "the order was passed by the District Revenue Officer who held that Abdul Khader was not a protected tenant\t",
        "He held further that Khasra Pahani which is the basic record of occupancy period after spot inspections does not find the name of Abdul Khader and further held that all entries except this entry in the Protected Tenancy Register prepared under section 37A of the Andhra Pradesh Act was supported by an enquiry\t",
        "It was in those circumstances held by him that the entry was a spurious one\t",
        "In Civil Revision Petition No.1006 of 1972 which was filed by Abdul Khader as against others,Justice R.Ramachandra Raju of the Andhra Pradesh High Court on or about 19th August,1974 held that Abdul Khader was not a protected tenant and directed deletion of entry made in the Final Record of tenancies as a spurious one\t The learned Judge observed,inter alia,as follows: \"I am told by the counsel for both the parties that the lands in question were already acquired for military purpose under the Requisition and Acquisition of Immovable property Act,1952 and that Sri M.S.Sharma,the Additional Chief Judge,City Civil Court,Hyderabad has already been appointed as Arbitrator under the Act for determining the compensation and the persons entitled to it\tRuling by Lower Court Not only that,in the writ petition filed by the present petitioner in this Court,it was held that it is not necessary to go into the question whether the petitioner is a protected tenant or whether he has any prima facie interest in the property because they are the matters entirely within the sole jurisdiction of the arbitrator who has to be appointed under S.8 of the Act\tRuling by Lower Court Now,as the arbitrator has already been appointed,he will go into the matter as to whether the petitioner was a protected tenant of the lands or not and if he was the protected tenant to what share in the compensation amount he would be entitled to\tRuling by Lower Court Under these circumstances,the C.R.P.is dismissed with a direction that the entry made in the Final Record of Tenancies that the petitioner was the protected tenant,for the lands in question which is spurious as found by both the Revenue Divisional Officer and the District Revenue Officer should be deleted\tRuling by Lower Court",
        "There was an award by the arbitrator holding that as this Court had left it open to decide whether Abdul Khader was a protected tenant\t",
        "Despite the objection exercising the jurisdiction of the Arbitrator to go into the question of protected tenant,the arbitrator held that Abdul Khader was a protected tenant\t",
        "Aggrieved by the aforesaid award,the appellant claiming as one of the owners of the property filed a statutory appeal to the High Court\t",
        "In the meantime Abdul Khader filed an application on or about 21st of October,1984 for adducing additional evidence to mark Kaulnama dated 2nd of December,1950 for the first time and Oubuliatnama dated 2nd December,1950 as exhibits in deciding the protected tenancy rights\t",
        "The appellant objected to that application but the High Court on 1st April,1985\t",
        "appointed Advocate Commissioner to record additional evidence\t",
        "On or about 22nd of April,1985\t",
        "the appellant filed the objection reserving the right of raising the jurisdiction of the Arbitrator to go into the question whether Abdul Khader was a protected tenant in the light of the Act 21 of 1950.Three civil appeals were filed before this Court against the order of the High Court on 15th May,1985.This Court passed the order,on 19th August,1985.The said order is important and reads as follows:- \"Special leave are granted\t",

        "Shri Subba Rao,learned counsel for the respondents submits that the appellants should not be permitted to withdraw from the authorities concerned more than 40 per cent of the total compensation awarded in respect of the lands in question pending disposal of the appeal before the High Court\t",
        "We agree with his submission\t",
        "We direct that the appellants shall withdraw not more than 40 per cent of the compensation pending disposal of the appeal before the High Court\t",
        "The remaining 60 per cent shall be disbursed in accordance with the directions to be given by the High Court after hearing all the parties concerned\t",
        "The appeals were disposed of accordingly\t",

        "The judgment under appeal was passed on 15th of April,1986.This appeal arises out of the said judgment\t",
        "In the judgment under appeal which is directed against the award made by the arbitrator formulated the following four issues--(1) what is the value of the land; (2) who are entitled to the compensation amount; (3) whether Abdul Khader is a protected tenant of Sail Gulshan of the area 19-02 guntas excluding the land of buildings,wells,etc.and (4) what share is to be apportioned to successors of Sail Nawaz Jung\t",
        "It has to be borne in mind that in the award,the arbitrator after exhaustively discussing the evidence on record held that Abdul Khader was a protected tenant and as such further held that he was entitled to 60% of the compensation money payable for the acquisition of the land excluding the land of buildings,wells etc\t",

        "The High Court took into consideration the judgment in Suit No.13(1) of 195 1-52 by the tenant\t",

        "Abdul Khader was recognised as the tenant\t",
        "The land was taken possession of under a panchanama dated 12th of September,1963.According to the High Court the documents discussed in the judgment indicated that Shaik Hussain was a tenant from 1935.After his death on July 18,1949,his son Mohd\t",
        "Abdul Khader became a tenant\t",
        "In this background the Court addressed itself to the question whether Abdul Khader was a protected tenant or not entitled to 60% of the compensation\t",
        "The High Court was of the view that there was surfeit of evidence prior to the commencement of the Andhra Pradesh Act that Shaik Hussain was a tenant of the land\t",
        "The question was whether on enforcement of the said Act Abdul Khader,respondent herein,was a protected tenant\t",

        "Section 37A was enacted on 12th of March,1956.The High Court was,however,of the view that it cannot be said that it was for the revenue authorities alone to decide the issue because the arbitrator was ordered to decide the issue by the High Court on 19th August,1974 and by this Court on 30th of January,1975.The High Court also referred to the directions of this Court dated 19th August,1985 mentioned hereinbefore\t",
        "The High Court was of the view that the arbitrator was to decide that question and the arbitrator was not in error in deciding the issue in the manner it did\t",

        "If he was a tenant,the High Court observed.he was a protected tenant under s.34 read with s.37 or under section 37-A of the Andhra Pradesh Act\t The High Court on reciting the facts came to the conclusions,inter alia\tRuling by Lower Court a) that Abdul Khader because he was a tenant between January,1942 to January,1948 for six years,therefore,was a protected tenant under sub-cl.(ii) of cl.(1) of s.34 of the Andhra Pradesh Act; (b) that Abdul Khader held the land from October,1943 to October,1949,therefore,was a protected tenant of Sail Gulshan under sub-cl.(iii) of cl.(1) of s.34 of Act 21 of 1950.In these circumstances,the High Court held that Adbul Khader was entitled to 60% of the compensation paid\tRuling by Lower Court"
    ],
    "Argument": [
        "Shri Shanker Ghosh,learned counsel for the appellant,urged that under the said Andhra Pradesh Act it was mandatory under s.99 read with s.102 of the said Act in conjunction with the definition of s.2(r) of the Act for the revenue authorities to decide whether Abdul Khader was a protected tenant or not\t",
        "Shri A.K.Sen,on behalf of the respondents on the other hand contended that the compensation payable in respect of the requisitioning and acquisition must be determined under the Central Act and the arbitrator was the authority to decide that question\t",
        "The question of Abdul Khader's right to compensation had to be decided in accordance with law\t",
        "He had claimed rights of a protected tenant\t",
        "He had sought to establish his rights which must be found within the four corners of the Andhra Pradesh Act along with other documents because u/s.40(4) of the Andhra Pradesh Act the interest of a protected tenant in the land held by him as a protected tenant formed 60%.The rights of the protected tenants have been defined in the Andhra Pradesh Act and relevant provisions of that Act namely,sections 34,37,37A and 40 in conjunction with the definition under s.2(r) have to be taken into consideration in the background of the facts and circumstances of the case\t",
        "The two orders of this Court as we have mentioned hereinbefore dated 30th of January,1975 and 19th of August.1985 reiterated the position that it was for the arbitrator to decide the question and he should decide the question in the light of ss.99 and 102 of the Andhra Pradesh Act as set out hereinbefore\t",
        "On behalf of the appellant it was submitted that there was a complete bar for any civil court to go into the question whether Abdul Khader was a protected tenant and as such the arbitrator and the High Court had no jurisdiction to decide this question\t",
        "For this reliance was placed on S.102 of the Andhra Pradesh Act which lays down that the Act will not apply to lands leased,granted,alienated or acquired in favour of or by the Central Government or the State Government etc.and on -S.99 of the Act which bars the jurisdiction of civil courts to deal with any question which is under the Andhra Pradesh Act required to be settled,to be decided or dealt with by the Tahsildar,Tribunal or Collector\t",
        "According to the appellant inasmuch as whether Abdul Khader was a protected tenant had not to be settled by the Collector or the Tribunal,the arbitrator and the High Court were in error in going to that question\t"
    ],
    "Ratio of the decision": [
        "It is relevant at this stage to refer to certain provisions of the Central Act to consider the controversy involved in this appeal.the Central Act was enacted giving power for requisitioning and acquisition of immovable property for Union purposes\t S.3 of the said Act gave power to requisition immovable property\tStatute S.4 of the said Act empowers taking possession of requisitioned property\tStatute S.5 deals with rights over requisitioned property\tStatute S.6 deals with the power of release from the requisitioning\tStatute S.7 authorises the Central Government where it is of the opinion that it is necessary to do so to acquire requisitioned property\tStatute S.8 deals with 'principles and method of determining compensation either for requisitioning or acquisition of the property and,inter alia,provides for appointment of an arbitrator in certain contingencies in case there was no agreement for determining compensation\tStatute S.9 deals with the payment of compensation and provides that the amount of compensation payable under an award shall,subject to any rules made under that Act,be paid by a competent authority to the person or persons entitled thereto in such manner and within such time as may be specified in the award\tStatute",
        "In this appeal we are concerned with the question whether the High Court was right in upholding the award of the arbitrator so far as it has held in favour of Abdul Khader and his rights to get 60% of the compensation\t",
        "The High Court dealt with the value of the land\t",
        "We are not concerned with the challenge to this aspect in this appeal\t",
        "We are also not concerned with this aspect of the matter inasmuch as the same is the subject matter of another appeal being Civil Appeal No.4406 of 1986\t",
        "We are concerned in this appeal with the right of Abdul Khader\t",
        "No document was filed to show that Abdul Khader was declared by the revenue courts as a protected tenant\t",
        "Aggrieved by the aforesaid decision,the appellants being the successor of the owner of the land in question is in appeal before us\t",
        "There being no such finding by the revenue officer,on the other hand there being a finding mat Abdul Khader was not a protected tenant by the revenue authorities it was not open to the arbitrator to decide the question of protected tenancy\t",
        "The arbitrator therefore,exceeded his jurisdiction and the High Court was in error\t",
        "We are unable to accept this submission\t",
        "By the scheme of the Central Act compensation was payable to persons who had interest in the land acquired\t",
        "Who are the persons who have interest in the land had to be decided in accordance with the law and the evidence\t",
        "Determination by the revenue authorities and non-determination is not conclusive or decisive\t",
        "It is clear that s.102 of the Andhra Pradesh Act mentions that after acquisition the Act was not to apply in respect of certain land\t",
        "Therefore,it was submitted by the respondents that s.99 of the Andhra Pradesh Act.which made the determination by the Tahsildar to be final and debarred other courts from going into the question did not apply in case of compensation payable\t",
        "In the background of the totality of circumstances as manifest in the different orders it appeared to the arbitrator and the Court that the entry which was made in favour of Abdul Khader as the protected tenant was of doubtful validity\t",
        "We are of the opinion that the High Court was not in error in so holding\t",
        "It was the observation of the revenue authorities that it was spurious\t",
        "That in any event what was the interest of Abdul Khader had to be determined in determining the question of payment of compensation to him and in so determining the facts and circumstances and the proceedings before the revenue authorities and entries and subsequent deletions had to be taken into consideration by the arbitrator\t",
        "The arbitrator has done so\t",
        "He had jurisdiction to do so\t",
        "The High Court has so held\t",
        "This Court by the two orders referred to hereinbefore had also affirmed this position\t",
        "In that view of the matter we are unable to accept the challenge to the award\t",
        "Furthermore,under s.99 of the Andhra Pradesh Act the bar was not against the arbitrator but against a civil court\t",
        "In determining the amount of compensation payable to Abdul Khader under the Central Act,his interests in the property had to be determined\t",
        "In another context,the High Court of Andhra Pradesh enunciated the position that it was necessary to determine the interest of the persons claiming compensation\t",
        "The Land Acquisition Officer or the Court,as the case may be,had to ascertain the value of a claimant's right in the property acquired and compensate him in that behalf\t",
        "We may mention that in the two orders of this Court dated 30th of January,1975 and 19th of August,1985 referred to herein before,this Court had left it open to the High Court and to the arbitrator to decide whether he is a protected tenant or not.the arbitrator has decided that question and the High Court found over whelming evidence in support of it\t",
        "In that view of the matter we must uphold that decision however unsatisfactory\t",
