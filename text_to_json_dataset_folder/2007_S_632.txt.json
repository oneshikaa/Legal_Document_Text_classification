        "The posts of field staffs of the Revenue Department of the State of Manipur were,thus,required to be filled up having regard to the said constitutional scheme\t",
        "We would proceed on the assumption that the State had not framed any recruitment rules in terms of the proviso appended to Art.309 of the Constitution of India but the same by itself would not clothe the Commissioner of Revenue to make recruitments in violation of the provisions contained in Arts.14 and 16 of the Constitution of India\t",
        "The offers of appointment issued in favour of the respondents herein were cancelled inter alia on the premise that the same had been done without the knowledge of the Revenue Department of the State\t",
        "No records there for were available with the State\t",
        "As noticed hereinbefore,an inquiry had been made wherein the said Shri Tayeng,the then Commissioner of Revenue stated that no such appointment had been made to his knowledge\t",
        "The State proceeded on the said basis\t",
        "The offers of appointment were cancelled not on the ground that some irregularities had been committed in the process of recruitment but on the ground that they had been non-est in the eye of law\t",
        "The purported appointment letters were fake ones\t",
        "They were not issued by any authority competent therefor\t",
        "If the offers of appointments issued in favour of the respondents herein were forged documents,the State could not have been compelled to pay salaries to them from the State exchequer\t",
        "Any action,which had not been taken by an authority competent therefor and in complete violation of the constitutional and legal framework,would not be binding on the State\t",
        "In any event,having regard to the fact that the said authority himself had denied to have issued a letter,there was no reason for the State not to act pursuant thereto or in furtherance thereof\t",
        "The action of the State did not,thus,lack bonafide\t",
        "Moreover,it was for the respondents who had filed the writ petitions to prove existence of legal right in their favour\t",
        "They had inter alia prayed for issuance of a writ of or in the nature of mandamus\t",
        "It was,thus,for them to establish existence of a legal right in their favour and a corresponding legal duty in the respondents to continue to be employed\t",
        "With a view to establish their legal rights to enable the High Court to issue a writ of mandamus,the respondents were obligated to establish that the appointments had been made upon following the constitutional mandate adumbrated in Arts.14 and 16 of the Constitution of India\t",

    "Precedent": [
        "In Kumari Shrilekha Vidyarthi 1990 Indlaw SC 463 (supra),this Court was dealing with a question in regard to continuance of the Law Officers\tP",
        "The question which arose herein was not raised\tP",
        "It was held: \"34.In our opinion,the wide sweep of Art.14 undoubtedly takes within its fold the impugned circular issued by the State of U.P.in exercise of its executive power,irrespective of the precise nature of appointment of the Government Counsel in the districts and the other rights,contractual or statutory,which the appointees may have\tP",
        "It is for this reason that we base our decision on the ground that independent of any statutory right,available to the appointees,and assuming for the purpose of this case that the rights flow only from the contract of appointment,the impugned circular,issued in exercise of the executive power of the State,must satisfy Art.14 of the Constitution and if it is shown to be arbitrary,it must be struck down\tP",
        "However,we have referred to certain provisions relating to initial appointment,termination or renewal of tenure to indicate that the action is controlled at least by settled guidelines,followed by the State of U.P.,for a long time\tP",
        "This too is relevant for deciding the question of arbitrariness alleged in the present case\tP",
        "35.It is now too well settled that every State action,in order to survive,must not be susceptible to the vice of arbitrariness which is the crux of Art.14 of the Constitution and basic to the rule of law,the system which governs us\tP",
        "Arbitrariness is the very negation of the rule of law\tP",
        "Satisfaction of this basic test in every State action is sine qua non to its validity and in this respect,the State cannot claim comparison with a private individual even in the field of contract\tP",
        "This distinction between the State and a private individual in the field of contract has to be borne in the mind\tP",

        "Their appointments are made through open competition from among those who are eligible for appointment and strictly on the basis of merit as evidenced by the particulars of their practice,opinions of the District Magistrate and the District Judge and also after taking into consideration their character and conduct\tP",
        "Their appointment is in the first instance for one year\tP",
        "It is only after their satisfactory performance during that period that a deed of engagement is given to them,and even then the engagement is to be for a term not exceeding three years\tP",

        "The shortcomings in the work are required to be brought to the notice of the Legal Remembrancer\tP",
        "It will thus be seen that the appointment of the two sets of officers,viz.,the Government Counsel in the High Court with whom we are concerned,and the District Government Counsel with whom the said decision was concerned,are made by dissimilar procedures\tP",
