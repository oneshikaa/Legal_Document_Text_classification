        "In paragraph 36 of the order of detention,the detaining authority stated: \"In view of the facts mentioned above,I have no hesitation in arriving at the conclusion that you have through your acts of omission and commission indulged in prejudicial activities as narrated above\t",
        "Considering the nature and gravity of the offence,the well planned manner in which you have engaged yourself in such prejudicial activities and your role therein as brought out above,all of which reflect your high potentiality and propensity to indulge in such prejudicial activities in future,I am satisfied that there is a need to prevent you from indulging in such prejudicial activities in future by detention under COFEPOSA ACT,1974 with a view to preventing you from smuggling goods in future\t",
        "What is,therefore,relevant was as to whether the documents were material\t",
        "If the documents were material so as to enable the detenue to make an effective representation which is his constitutional as also statutory right,non-supply thereof would vitiate the order of detention\t"
    ],
    "Argument": [
        "Although before the High Court,the principal ground urged on behalf of Appellant in questioning the legality or validity of the order of detention was unexplained delay in passing the order of detention which did not find favour with the High Court\t",
        "The learned Additional Solicitor General,who appeared on behalf of Respondent has drawn our attention to a long list of dates showing that searches were conducted and statements of a large number of persons had to be recorded\t",
        "The final order of detention was preceded not only on the basis of raids conducted in various premises,recording of statements of a large number of witnesses,carrying on intensive inquiries both within India and outside India,obtaining test reports from three different laboratories but also the fact that despite notices Appellant and his associates did not cooperate with the investigating authorities\t",
        "They initiated various civil proceedings from time to time,obtained various interim orders and,thus,delay in passing the order of detention cannot be said to have not been explained\t",
        "Learned counsel would contend that keeping in view the nature and magnitude of an offence under COFEPOSA,a distinction must be made between an order of detention passed under COFEPOSA vis-a-vis other Acts as per the law laid down by this Court in Rajendrakumar Natvarlal Shah v\t",
        "State of Gujarat and Others [(1988) 3 SCC 153 1988 Indlaw SC 71] and in that view of the matter the High Court must be held to have arrived at a correct decision\t"
    ],
    "Ratio of the decision": [
        "Before us,several other grounds,viz.,non placement of vital/ material documents before the detaining authority,non-supply of documents relied on or referred to in the order of detention as also non-application of mind on the part of the detaining authority had been raised\t",
        "In the meantime admittedly the period of detention being over,Appellant had been set at large\t",
        "He was released from custody on 17.5.2006\t This appeal,however,has been pressed as a proceeding under the Smugglers and Foreign Exchange Manipulators (Forfeiture of Property) Act,1976 (for short \"SAFEMA\"),has been initiated against Appellant\tStatute",
        "We may first deal with the question of unexplained delay\t",
        "In this regard we may notice the following dates\t",
        "Indisputably,delay to some extent stands explained\t",
        "But,we fail to understand as to why despite the fact that the proposal for detention was made on 2.12.2004,the order of detention was passed after four months\t",
        "We must also notice that in the meantime on 20.12.2004,the authorities of the DRI had clearly stated that transactions after 11.10.2003 were not under the scrutiny stating: \"In our letter mentioned above,your office was requested not to issue the DEPB scripts to M/s\t",
        "Girnar Impex Limited and M/s\t",
        "Siri Amar Exports,only in respect of the pending application,if any,filed by these parties up to the date of action i.e.11.10.2003 as the past exports were under scrutiny being doubtful as per the intelligence received in this office\t",
        "This office never intended to stop the export incentives occurring to the parties,after the date of action i.e.11.10.2003.In the civil,your office letter\t",
        "No.B.L.-2/Misc\t",
        "Am-2003/Ldh dated 17.05.2004 is being referred,which is not received in this office\t",
        "You are,therefore,requested to supply photocopy of the said letter to the bearer of this letter as this letter is required for filing reply to the Hon'ble Court\t",
        "Furthermore,as noticed hereinbefore,the authorities of the DRI by a letter dated 28.02.2005 requested the Bank to defreeze the bank accounts of Appellant\t",
        "The said documents,in our opinion,were material\t",
        "It was,therefore,difficult to appreciate why order of detention could not be passed on the basis of the materials gathered by them\t",
        "It is no doubt true that if the delay is sufficiently explained,the same would not be a ground for quashing an order of detention under COFEPOSA,but as in this case a major part of delay remains unexplained\t",
        "Delay,as is well known,at both stages has to be explained\t",
        "The court is required to consider the question having regard to the overall picture\t",
        "In the instant case,we have noticed hereinbefore that the authorities of DRI themselves categorically stated that the activities of Appellant after 11.10.2003 were not in question and in fact all the bank accounts were defreezed\t",
        "Although learned Additional Solicitor General may be correct in his submissions that ordinarily we should not exercise our discretionary jurisdiction u/art.136 of the Constitution of India by allowing Appellant to raise new grounds but,in our opinion,we may have to do so as an order of detention may have to be considered from a different angle\t",
        "It may be true that the period of detention is over\t",
        "It may further be true that Appellant had remained in detention for the entire period but it is one thing to say that the writ of Habeas Corpus in this circumstances cannot issue but it is another thing to say that an order of detention is required to be quashed so as to enable the detainee to avoid his civil liabilities under SAFEMA as also protect his own reputation\t",
        "In a case of this nature,we do not think,in view of the admitted facts,that we would not permit Appellant to raise the said questions\t",
        "We have noticed hereinbefore that learned Additional Solicitor General contended that Appellant obstructed the proceedings by initiating various civil litigations\t",
        "But,indisputably,those documents involving the civil court proceedings were not placed before the detaining authority\t",
        "If the same had not been done,not only the delay,in issuing the order of detention stood unexplained but also thereby the order itself would become vitiated\t",
        "Furthermore,the civil court proceedings were over on 19.11.2004\t",
        "Evidently,the detaining authority did not take immediate steps to detain Appellant\t",
        "Why the documents pertaining to the proceedings of the Civil Court had not been placed before the detaining authority has not been explained\t",
        "On their own showing,Respondents admit that they were relevant documents\t",
        "We have been taken through the order of detention\t",
        "The statements of Appellant and the said Prabhjot Singh were recorded therein in extenso\t",
        "Recording of such statement must have been made from the xeroxed copies of such documents which were available with the detaining authority\t",
        "The self-inculpatory statements of Appellant as also Prabhjot Singh purported to have been made in terms of S.108 of the Customs Act were required to be considered before the order of detention could be passed\t",
        "The same was not done\t",
        "The original of such documents might not been available with the detaining authority but admittedly the xeroxed copies were\t",
        "It has not been denied or disputed that even the xeroxed copies of the said documents had not been supplied to the detenue\t",
        "It may be true that Appellant in his representation dated 14.06.2005 requested for showing him the original documents referred to or mentioned in the grounds of detention but then at least the xeroxed copies thereof should have been made available to him\t",
        "Union of India and Another\t",
        "It is a trite law that all documents which are not material are not necessary to be supplied\t",
        "What is necessary to be supplied is the relevant and the material documents,but,thus,all relevant documents must be supplied so as to enable the detenue to make an effective representation which is his fundamental right u/art.22(5) of the Constitution of India\t",
        "Right to make an effective representation is also a statutory right.[See Sunila Jain v\t",
        "2006) 3 SCC 321 2006 Indlaw SC 65\t",
        "In this case,the statements of Appellant and Prabhjot Singh,in our opinion,were material\t",
        "They could not have been withheld\t",
        "If original of the said documents were not available,xeroxed copies thereof could have been made available to him\t",
        "The detaining authority moreover while relying on the said documents in one part of the order of detention could not have stated in another part that he was not relying thereupon\t",
        "The very fact that he had referred to the said statements in ex tenso is itself a pointer to the fact that he had relied upon the said documents\t",
        "Even in the earlier part of the impugned order of detention,i.e.detaining authority appears to have drawn his own conclusions\t"

    "Precedent": [
        "We may also place on record that Sen.,J.in Rajendrakumar Natvarlal Shah 1988 Indlaw SC 71 (supra),while laying down various stages of the procedures leading to an order of detention,opined that rule as to unexplained delay in taking action is not inflexible and a detention under COFEPOSA may be considered from a different angle\tP",
        "The question came up for consideration recently in Rajinder Arora v\tP",
        "Union of India and Others [(2006) 4 SCC 796 2006 Indlaw SC 87] wherein it has been held: \"Furthermore no explanation whatsoever has been offered by the Respondent as to why the order of detention has been issued after such a long time\tP",
        "The said question has also not been examined by the authorities before issuing the order of detention\tP",
        "The question as regard delay in issuing the order of detention has been held to be a valid ground for quashing an order of detention by this Court in T.D.Abdul Rahman v\tP",

        "No hard and fast rule can be precisely formulated that would be applicable under all circumstances and no exhaustive guidelines can be laid down in that behalf\tP",
        "It follows that the test of proximity is not a rigid or mechanical test by merely counting number of months between the offending acts and the order of detention\tP",
        "However,when there is undue and long delay between the prejudicial activities and the passing of detention order,the court has to scrutinise whether the detaining authority has satisfactorily examined such a delay and afforded a tenable and reasonable explanation as to why such a delay has occasioned,when called upon to answer and further the court has to investigate whether the causal connection has been broken in the circumstances of each case\tP",
        "Similarly when there is unsatisfactory and unexplained delay between the date of order of detention and the date of securing the arrest of the detenu,such a delay would throw considerable doubt on the genuineness of the subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority leading to a legitimate inference that the detaining authority was not really and genuinely satisfied as regards the necessity for detaining the detenu with a view to preventing him from acting in a prejudicial manner\tP",
        "The delay caused in this case in issuing the order of detention has not been explained\tP",

        "It would be reasonable to assume that if the District Magistrate of Burdwan was really and genuinely satisfied after proper application of mind to the materials before him that it was necessary to detain the petitioner with a view to preventing him from acting in a prejudicial manner,he would have acted with greater promptitude both in making the order of detention as also in securing the arrest of the petitioner,and the petitioner would not have been allowed to remain at large for such a long period of time to carry on his nefarious activities\tP",
