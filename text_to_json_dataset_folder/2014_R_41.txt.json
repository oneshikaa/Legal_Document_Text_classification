        "In fact,he even came to the Court in the company of a police constable after being served summons at Allahabad\t",
        "The learned counsel submitted that the evidence of a child witness must be carefully scrutinized before acceptance since a child can be easy prey for tutoring and the court must insist on corroboration from other evidence\t",
        "The learned counsel for the appellants forcefully attacked the conviction of the other accused viz\t",
        "Mahesh,Chandra Prakash and Devendra Kumar,who admittedly were not known to the child witness Anil Kumar\t",
        "It was submitted that the test identification parade were delayed and the identification of these accused by the witness in Court was not reliable\t",
        "Mr\t",
        "P.C.Agrawala,learned senior counsel for the appellant Mahesh (accused no.3),vehemently submitted that this accused ought not to have been convicted u/s.302 with the aid of Ss.34 and 120 (B) of IPC.In particular it was submitted that the role attributed to the accused was that he merely stood outside the house\t",
        "He did not even act as a guard because when the witness Anil Kumar (PW-21) came to the house,he was not even stopped by the accused from entering the house\t",
        "The learned counsel for Mahesh (accused no.3) relied on several decisions of this Court in Suresh Sakharam Nangare Vs\t",

    ],
    "Ratio of the decision": [
        "We have carefully examined the manner in which the identification parade was conducted and the manner in which the boy -Anil Kumar (PW-21) identified the accused in Court and we have no reason to doubt the identification of the accused,which assumes importance in this case since the boy did not know the accused before the incident\t",
        "This deposition clearly implicates accused Nos.1,2 and 4.The picture that emerges is that Shashi Tripathi caused Bhavna to be killed and for this purpose engaged Chandra Prakash (accused No.2) and Raju\t",
        "Devendra Choubey (accused No.4) by paying them money\t",
        "She also seems to have had a scuffle with Bhavna,which is apparent from the fact that her hair was found in the grip of the deceased during investigation\t",
        "It is obvious that accused nos.2 and 4 did not enter the house to commit a robbery and had a single mission,namely,to kill Bhavana\t",
        "There is no evidence that they had any previous animosity with the deceased and appeared to have acted as contract killers\t",
        "The prosecution has found it difficult to pinpoint the motive but Shashi Tripathi's husband Dr\t",
        "Sharda Prasad Tripathi (PW-1) deposed before the Court that she tried to create a hindrance in the marriage of his son Jitendra since she wanted her daughter Abhilasha to marry him; however,he went ahead with the marriage of Jitendra to Bhavna,whereupon Shashi Tripathi remained silent\t",
        "On a careful perusal of the deposition of this child witness,we have not found any reason why he would have lied\t",
        "He was brought to the house by Shashi Tripathi (accused),who apparently took care of him and sent to school and gave him food and residence\t",
        "He had no grouse against her neither any ulterior motive in identifying the accused,who were not acquainted to him\t",
        "There was no reason for the sole eye witness -Anil (PW-21) to implicate anybody falsely\t",
        "Merely because he has been some time in the company of the police at the police station his testimony cannot be discarded as untrue\t",
        "The incident occurred within the four walls of the house of the accused -Shashi Tripathi and the only witness was the boy -Anil\t",
        "PW-21).His statement that the accused Chandra Prakash attacked the deceased is corroborated by the recovery of knife from Chandra Prakash\t",
        "It must be remembered that the boy comes from a rural back ground and was 13 years of age when the incident occurred\t",
        "His presence in the house is entirely natural and we have no reason to discard his testimony\t",
        "It is not possible for us to accept this contention\t",
        "Mahesh and Chandra Prakash were arrested on 29.11.2003,their identification parade was conducted on 13.12.2003 -(within a fortnight or so\t",
        "The accused Devendra Kumar was arrested on 22.12.2003 and his identification parade was conducted on 26.12.2003-(within four days).There is no evidence on record to show that the child witness had an opportunity to see and study the features of the accused between their arrest and test identification parade to enable a tutored identification\t",
        "In any case,the period between the arrest and the identification parade was not large enough to constitute inordinate delay\t",
        "The observations of this Court undoubtedly lay down the correct law and we have no reason to doubt them\t",
        "We,however,do not see how the observations help the appellants\t",
        "In the present case,the child witness has been found to be reliable\t",
        "His presence is not doubted,since he resided with the family for whom he worked\t",
        "He had no axe to grind against any of the accused\t",
        "He became the unfortunate witness of a gruesome murder and fearlessly identified the accused in Court\t",
        "In his deposition he specified the details of the part which the accused played with reasonable particularity\t",
        "In such a situation,it is considered a safe rule of prudence to generally look for corroboration of the sworn testimony of witness in Court as to the identity of the accused who are strangers to them,in the form of earlier identification proceeding,as observed by this Court in Budhsen's case 1970 Indlaw SC 136 (supra\t",
        "This Court has not laid down the requirement in general that all identification parades must be under the supervision of a Magistrate as in Budhsen's case 1970 Indlaw SC 136 (supra).The learned counsel for the appellants also relied upon the Judgments of this Court in Subash and Shiv Kumar Vs\t",

        "Suffice it to say that those cases do not create any doubt as regards the conviction in this case\t",
        "It is settled law that common intention and conspiracy are matters of inference and if while drawing an inference any benefit of doubt creeps in,it must go to the accused vide Baliya Vs\t",
        "State of M.P.(2012\t",
        "9 SCC 696 2012 Indlaw SC 343\t",
        "On a careful conspectus of the facts and the law,we are of the view that the prosecution has failed to prove the guilt of Mahesh beyond reasonable doubt\t",
        "There is no evidence of his having played any part in the crime\t",
        "He was merely seen by the witness as standing outside the house when the witness came home\t",

        "No weapon was seized from him,nor was any property connected with the crime,seized\t",

        "As a general rule,the substantive evidence of a witness is a statement made in court\tP",
        "The evidence of mere identification of the accused person at the trial for the first time is from its very nature inherently of a weak character\tP",
        "The evidence in order to carry conviction should ordinarily clarify as to how and under what circumstances he came to pick out the particular accused person and the details of the part which the accused played in the crime in question with reasonable particularity\tP",
        "The purpose of a prior test identification,therefore,seems to be to test and strengthen the trustworthiness of that evidence\tP",
        "It is accordingly considered a safe rule of prudence to generally look for corroboration of the sworn testimony of witnesses in court as to the identity of the accused who are strangers to them,in the form of earlier identification proceeding\tP",
        "There may,however,be exceptions to this general rule,when for example,the court is impressed by a particular witness,on whose testimony it can safely rely,without such or other corroboration\tP",
        "The identification parades belong to the investigation stage\tP",
        "They are generally held during the course of investigation with the primary object of enabling the witnesses to identify persons concerned in the offence,who were not previously known to them\tP",
        "This serves to satisfy the investigating officers of the bona fides of the prosecution witnesses and also to furnish evidence to corroborate their testimony in court\tP",
        "Identification proceedings in their legal effect amount simply to this: that certain persons are brought to jail or some other place and make statements either express or implied that certain individuals whom they point out are persons whom they recognise as having been concerned in the crime\tP",
        "They do not constitute substantive evidence\tP",
        "These parades are of the essentially governed by Section 162,Criminal Procedure Code\tP",
        "It is for this reason that the identification parades in this case seem to have been held under the supervision of a Magistrate\tP",
        "Keeping in view the purpose of identification parades the Magistrates holding them are expected to take all possible precautions to eliminate any suspicion of unfairness and to reduce the chance of testimonial error\tP",
        "They must,therefore,take intelligent interest in the proceedings,bearing in mind two considerations: (i) that the life and liberty of an accused may depend on their vigilance and caution and (ii) that justice should be done in the identification\tP",
        "Those proceeding should not make it impossible for the identifiers who,after all,have,as a rule,only fleeting glimpses of the person they are supposed to identify\tP",
        "Generally speaking,the Magistrate must make a note of every objection raised by an accused at the time of identification and the steps taken by them to ensure fairness to the accused,so that the court which is to judge the value of the identification evidence may take them into consideration in the appreciation of that evidence\tP",
        "The power to identify,it may be kept in view,varies according to the power of observation and memory of the person identifying and each case depends on its own facts,but there are two factors which seem to be of basic importance in the evaluation of identification\tP",
        "The persons required to identify an accused should have had no opportunity of seeing him after the commission of the crime and before identification and secondly that no mistakes are made by them or the mistakes made are negligible\tP",
        "The identification to be of value should also be held without much delay\tP",
        "The number of persons mixed up with the accused should be reasonably large and their bearing and general appearance not glaringly dissimilar\tP",
        "The evidence as to identification deserves,therefore,to be subjected to a close and careful scrutiny by the Court\tP"
